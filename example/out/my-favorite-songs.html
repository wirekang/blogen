    <h1>Galway Girl</h1>

<p>She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, &ldquo;Baby, I just want to dance&rdquo;</p>

<h1>All Falls Down</h1>

<p>What&rsquo;s the trick? I wish I knew
I&rsquo;m so done with thinking through all the things I could&rsquo;ve been
And I know you want me, too
All it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you
You cross that line and it&rsquo;s time to say F you</p>
