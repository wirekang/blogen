# Galway Girl
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

# All Falls Down
What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through all the things I could've been
And I know you want me, too
All it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you
You cross that line and it's time to say F you
